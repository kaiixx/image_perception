# Creating a Aimbot using Object Detection and Handpose

This project aims to create an auto-aim system that shoots the primary target in the popular game, moorhuhn chicken, while the user performs other controls using hand signs.

This was created using the RetinaNet architecture from tensorflow and the Mediapipe python API.
